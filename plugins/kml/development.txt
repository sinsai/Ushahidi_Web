//=== TODO ===================
// "Submitted" may not be the correct title... should it be "Incident Date/Time" or similar?  Other date/times to consider?
// KMZ File Bunding
//    add code to bundle icons in KMZ if option is set
//    add option & code to bundle media image thumbnials into KMZ
// Category Strings
//    Detect category length, if short, show as PARENT >> SUBCAT (one line)
//    refactor code to only show category icons (not titles) in balloons
//    add category links to category icons (& text?) in balloons (done for "icons" type of cat string)
// Folders
//    for Empty Cat/Subcat Folders, indicate they are empty (with text added to name, or indicator placemark)
//    add option & code to put placemarks in parent folder (with other subcat folders) into another folder ("Other", etc.?)



//=== TODO, maybe, later...
// only write new if new incidents added
// Check GMaps functionality
// Check on category image transparency??
// Update KML/KMZ using Scheduler??
// Generate Legend?  
// Internationalization?
// Auto limits on items retrieved/shown?
// Option for radio buttons?
// Option selection page or file?
// Add to API
// Make x.kml and x.kmz and x_nl.kml available as files
// GeoSiteMap!
// Check reliability and future plans for Swatch generator
// Is there a mobile web version of Ushahidi that could feed pages into balloons (iframe)? (Maps compatible?)
// Think about other ways to notify user of update data/staleness ... screen overlay date?  Other options? How important?
// Think about best way to add Network Link functionality for automatic updates
// If providing network link, what's the best way to provide download of static version: in top level doc balloon?  In a folder title (make it a link)?


//=== DONE ===
// add option & code to only show category icons (not titles) in balloons
// change some more options from 1/0 to true/false (where applicable)
// remove space before image thumbnail
// Add "updated" timestamp to top level folder snippett
// for media links, get domain of link as hyperlink text
// for media links, detect when link is empty, and don't write it.
// NOT FEASIBLE (would change balloon title too): add option & code to limit length of placemark labels (limit # of characters, cut off on word boundary)
